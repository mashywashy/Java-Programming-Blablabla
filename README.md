# Java Competitive Programming Practice

This repository contains solutions and practice exercises for competitive programming using Java. It is designed to help you master the essential techniques and algorithms needed to efficiently solve problems related to array and string manipulations.

## Topics Covered:
- **2-pointer Technique**: Learn how to solve problems involving two indices working together to optimize time complexity.
- **3-pointer Technique**: Advanced version of the 2-pointer approach, useful for problems with three moving elements.
- **HashMaps**: Master key-value pair storage for quick lookups and solving problems like counting, searching, and frequency analysis.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Implement optimal solutions for problems that require making the best local choices at each step.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Dive into solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing solutions to avoid redundant work.

## Problem Types:
- Array Manipulation
- String Manipulation
- Sliding Window
- Subarrays & Subsequences
- Interval Scheduling
- Pattern Matching
- Sequence Alignment

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-competitive-programming.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the appropriate folder for each technique or problem type.
3. Explore, practice, and contribute solutions in Java!
